            been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now

            ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.`,

    quote: `I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than

    quote: `Taking LSD was a profound experience, one of the most important things in my life. 
            LSD shows you that there’s﻿ another side to the coin, and you can’t remember it when 
            it wears off, but you know it. It reinforced my sense of what was important—creating 
            great things instead of making money, putting things back into the stream of history
             and of human consciousness as much as I could.`,

    quote: `Walter Issacson biographer of Steve Jobs: I remember sitting in his backyard in his 
          garden, one day, and he started talking about God. He [Jobs] said, “ Sometimes I 
          believe in God, sometimes I don’t. I think it’s 50/50, maybe. But ever since I’ve had 
          cancer, I’ve been thinking about it more, and I find myself believing a bit more, 
          maybe it’s because I want to believe in an afterlife, that when you die, it doesn’t 
          just all disappear. The wisdom you’ve accumulated, somehow it lives on.”
          Then he paused for a second and said, “Yea, but sometimes, I think it’s just
          like an On-Off switch. Click. And you’re gone.” And then he paused again and 
          said, “ And that’s why I don’t like putting On-Off switches on Apple devices.`,

    quote: `I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am
            bound to live by the light that I have. I must stand with anybody that stands right, 
            and stand with him while he is right, and part with him when he goes wrong.`,
